# Hangman-Game

An exciting project I made when I was in final year at my highschool.

Since It's the first Game I ever made it's not the best thing but yeah I had alot of fun and got a lot of learning experience from this project.

But with that saying I can assure you will have fun playing the game :)

When you win/loose a game, It prints the message accordingly and then at the end it will print the sceret word
